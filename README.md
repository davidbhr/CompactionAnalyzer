# CompactionAnalyzer 

**Quantification of tissue compaction around cells**

The software is used to quantify the tissue compaction (as a measure of the contractile strength) generated by cells or spheroids that are embedded in fiber materials. This is done by evaluating the fiber direction to the cell center on one hand and the intensity around the cell on the other.
