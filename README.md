# CompactionAnalyzer - Quantification of tissue compaction in fiber materials around cells

Quantification of tissue compaction (as a measure of the contractile strength) for cells or spheroids that are embedded in fiber materials. This is done by evaluating the fiber direction to the cell center on one hand and the intensity around the cell on the other.
