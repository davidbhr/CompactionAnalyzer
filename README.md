# CompactionAnalyzer 

## Quantification of tissue compaction around cells

Python package to quantify the tissue compaction (as a measure of the contractile strength) generated by cells or spheroids that are embedded in fiber materials. For this we can use the two following approaches:

**A**: Evaluating the directionality of fibers towards the cell center <br>
**B**: Measuring the increased intensity around the cell is measured.  <br>




## Installation
The package can be installed by cloning this repository or downloading the repository as a zip file [here](https://github.com/davidbhr/CompactionAnalyzer/zipball/master). For installation, run the following command within the unzipped folder, in which the *setup.py* file is located: `pip install -e .`. This automatically downloads and installs all other required packages.

### Multicellular Compaction Assay

Also used to quantify Multicellular Compaction instead of single cells. This might have advantage same shape and no movement and can be done with same analysis

Furthermore, also direct measurement of contractile forces by using **Jointforces** can resolve contractility of tumor spheroids and drug responses.
