# CompactionAnalyzer 

## Quantification of tissue compaction around cells

Python package to quantify the tissue compaction (as a measure of the contractile strength) generated by cells or spheroids that are embedded in fiber materials. For this we can use the two following approaches:

**A**: Evaluating the directionality of fibers towards the cell center <br>
**B**: Measuring the increased intensity around the cell is measured.  <br>


## Installation
The package can be installed by cloning this repository or downloading the repository as a zip file [here](https://github.com/davidbhr/CompactionAnalyzer/zipball/master). For installation, run the following command within the unzipped folder, in which the *setup.py* file is located: `pip install -e .`. This automatically downloads and installs all other required packages.

### Multicellular Compaction Assay

Beneath individual cells also the compaction can bes assesed on a multicellular level using for example cell spheoids. This also offers the advantage that uniform round shape here and less moement The compaction can be accesed using the same analysis.

Additionally, absolute forces can be measured using the python package **Jointforces** LINK HERE (requires additonal material measurements & timelapse imaging)
