# CompactionAnalyzer 

## Quantification of tissue compaction around cells

Python package to quantify the tissue compaction generated by cells or spheroids that are embedded in fiber materials (as a measure of the contractile strength). For this we can use the two following approaches:

**A**: Evaluating the directionality of fibers towards the cell center <br>
**B**: Measuring the increased intensity around the cell is measured.  <br>




## Installation
The package can be installed by cloning this repository or downloading the repository as a zip file [here](https://github.com/davidbhr/CompactionAnalyzer/zipball/master). For installation, run the following command within the unzipped folder, in which the *setup.py* file is located: `pip install -e .`.
